# Demos Red

#### some demos for [**Red language**](http://www.red-lang.org/)    

**WARNING** presently [**Red GUI**](http://www.red-lang.org/2016/03/060-red-gui-system.html) run only on Windows

### Test demos from GIT 

First install last [**RED build**](http://www.red-lang.org/p/download.html) release > 0.6.0 *use last build*    
Start REPL then type:    
```do read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nodrygo/DemosRed/master/demosRunner.red```

or if you want a gui   
```do read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nodrygo/DemosRed/master/demosGuiRunner.red```

### unfinished simpleCAD demo

A lot of good CAD already exist so this demo is only an attempt for me to learn Red and nothing else    
Because this is my first big code this is really bad written and not idiomatic of good Red code. If I was doing it again I'll probably rewrite it differently

basic [screen shot here](https://github.com/nodrygo/DemosRed/blob/master/simpleCAD/images/redbicycle.png)


### Why 

I am leaning Red and those demos help me on this process *\(and may help you \:\-\) \)*

you can copy and paste the code directly in the REPL

## Binarie 

only one demo exe to download in winexe repository *\( some browser doen't allow these download \)*
