**WARNING**Red is far to be finished and still lack a lot of things so this code is a lot prematured and only for fun

### very basic demo for the most simple IDE

this is only for personal test and Red learning use it with care !!! 

* if you want `execute externaly` or use `compile` you must use the `exe` version 
because it add `CALL` to lauch you code outside   
*basicide.exe* need to have `red.exe` in your path 

to create your own `basicide.exe` do:   
`red -c -t windows basicide.exe`
